## Notes

While building the app i tried implementing the slider UI but I was unable to link the slider to affect the change of the total so I ended up discarding it. I had probems where the app would load but wouldnt affect any of the variables. It would just let me input the bill amount but it wouoldnt show any change so I had to fix that bug and after redoing the whole app I finally got it working.
